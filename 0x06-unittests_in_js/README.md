## Unit and Integration Testing with Mocha and Chai

### Overview
In this project, I learned about unit and integration testing using Mocha as the test framework and Chai as the assertion library. Throughout the exercise, I gained practical experience in writing test suites, using different assertion methods, handling asynchronous operations, and testing integration with a small Node.js server.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise, I was able to:

1. **Use Mocha for Test Suite**: Understand how to structure and write test suites using Mocha.
2. **Assertion Libraries**: Familiarize myself with different assertion libraries like Node's built-in `assert` module or Chai.
3. **Presentation of Test Suites**: Learn techniques to present long test suites in an organized and readable manner.
4. **Spies Usage**: Understand the concept of spies and know when and how to use them in testing.
5. **Stubs Usage**: Learn about stubs and their usage in replacing dependencies or controlling functions' behavior during testing.
6. **Hooks Usage**: Understand hooks in Mocha and know when to use them for setup and teardown operations.
7. **Unit Testing with Async Functions**: Learn how to write unit tests for asynchronous functions using Mocha's async testing support.
8. **Integration Testing with Node Server**: Gain experience in writing integration tests for a small Node.js server using Supertest.

### Project Structure
The project structure consists of:

- **Source Files**: Contains the application code to be tested.
- **Test Files**: Contains test suites for different parts of the application.
- **Test Runner Configuration**: Configuration for Mocha test runner.
- **README.md**: Detailed instructions and explanations about the project.

### Expected Deliverables
Upon completing this project, I had:

1. A comprehensive test suite covering different aspects of the application.
2. Clear and concise documentation explaining the purpose and usage of each test suite.
3. Understanding of various testing concepts including spies, stubs, hooks, and async testing.
4. Experience in writing integration tests for a small Node.js server.
5. A README.md file providing an overview of the project, learning objectives, project structure, and any additional information necessary for understanding and running the tests.

### Getting Started
To get started with the project:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`npm install`).
3. Implement the application code in the source files.
4. Write test suites to cover different functionalities of the application.
5. Run the test suites and ensure all tests pass.
6. Update the README.md file with detailed explanations and instructions.
